         a call back function is a function that is passed a an argument to another 
         function, to be "called back" at a later time.

           * promise takes a call back function as an argument
           * the call back function takes two arguments, resolve and reject.
           * the  callback holds the code that is to be executed asynchronously
           * the resolve and reject functions are used to return the result of the asyncrhonous operation
